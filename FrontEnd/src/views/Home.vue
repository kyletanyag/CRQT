  <h5>We are currently working on the development of a simulation platform which takes into account the guidelines 
	as discussed in the NIST 800-82 recommended Defense-In-Depth architecture for Industrial Control System (ICS).  
	The primary objective of the tool is to be able to perform Security audit of bulk power systems by providing 
	measurable values for the cyber security metrics such as resilience, robustness, redundancy and risk. The tool 
	considers various network components within different layers of a power system communication network and the 
	associated vulnerabilities for those network elements as defined in the NVD (National Vulnerability Database). 
	Primarily we are considering only the products (means vendor and product model) for each layer such as 
	corporate DMZ, corporate LAN, control system DMZ and control system LAN layers to have the corresponding 
	vulnerabilities in node level. Right now, we are considering the impacts in the physical layer by considering 
	a IEEE 9-bus system as discussed in [2]. We are working on how to allocate physical impacts (MW power lost due to an attack)
	by considering the power station nodes (such generation nodes and transmission nodes) connectivity. </h5>
