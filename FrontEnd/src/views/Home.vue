        <p class="text-justify">
          As new technology emerges, cyber-criminals become more creative in penetrating vulnerable systems changing their attack methods for different security systems. 
          The Cyber Resilience Quantification Tool (CRQT) helps to fortify a system's resiliency by taking in the customer's unique network topology, analyzing computation, 
          networking, and physical vulnerabilities, and prescribing mitigation remedies to fortify customer systems and make them more resilient. Protecting cyber network 
          infrastructures is essential, but it remains a balancing act between security versus cost. By developing a tool that will help stakeholders foresee possible attacks 
          and prioritize vulnerabilities by criticality, stakeholders (cybersecurity professionals and decision-makers) will be able to conduct cost-benefit risk assessments 
          of their CPS networks to address their organization's security thresholds and objectives.
